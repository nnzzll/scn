# Vertebrae Centroid Localization

This is a pytorch implementation of the vertebrae localization part of [Coarse to Fine Vertebrae Localization and Segmentation with SpatialConfiguration-Net and U-Net](https://doi.org/10.5220/0008975201240133)

This implementation is a little bit different to the original one and the work is still ongoing.
